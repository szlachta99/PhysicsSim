# PhysicsSim

PhysicsSim is a simple 2D rigidbody simulation project. The goal of this project is to create a basic physics engine that can handle 2D rigidbody dynamics. In the future, we aim to expand the project to include more advanced physical simulations.

## Features

- 2D rigidbody simulation
- Collision detection and response
- Basic physics properties (mass, velocity, acceleration)

## Future Plans

- Implement more advanced physical simulations
- Add support for different types of forces (e.g., gravity, friction)
- Improve collision detection algorithms
- Optimize performance for larger simulations
